# Snake Game using Ruby with gem ruby2d
## Tutorial credit to Mario Visic's tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UVhYHBT_1o
### I used this tutorial to practice some skills and create a snake game. I tried to figure out each piece before going on with the tutorial. Mario did a great job explaining and teaching in his video.
